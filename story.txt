Once upon a time, in a land filled with talking animals, there was a lazy cat named Mittens. Mittens loved to nap all day and never helped with any chores. One day, the king of the land announced that whoever could make him laugh the hardest would be crowned the court jester. Mittens, being the lazy cat that he was, decided to enter the competition. On the day of the competition, all sorts of funny animals performed their best jokes and tricks, but none of them made the king even crack a smile. Finally, it was Mittens turn. He walked up to the king, gave a big stretch, and said Your majesty, I'm just too tired to be funny. Can I take a nap instead? The king, unable to control his laughter, declared Mittens the winner and crowned him the court jester on the spot. From that day on, Mittens was in charge of entertaining the kingdom with his lazy antics, and everyone lived happily ever after including Mittens, who got to nap even more now that he had a fancy title. sorry dom right this way.
